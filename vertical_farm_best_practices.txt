Hydroponic vertical farms are already more sustainable than most traditional farming practices. They use far less water, require (and therefore degrade) no soil, and produce far less waste than a typical farm. They also don't add pollution to our groundwater with pesticides and chemical fertilizers. Supporters of vertical farming argue for its sustainability - but this necessitates leaving a belief in the importance of soil behind. At its best, it is a 'closed loop' system, that recycles inputs; and its efficiency in minimising water is an important part of why proponents feel vertical farming is sustainable. Indoor, Vertical Farming Has A Big Role In Sustainable Agriculture - Forbes. Vertical farming uses controlled environmental agriculture techniques, like hydroponics or aquaponics, to grow crops in vertically stacked rows with 90% less water than traditional soil-based farming. It also uses 75-90% less land than traditional farms and is able to be conducted in industrial areas.
